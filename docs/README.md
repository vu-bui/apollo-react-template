# Apollo React Template
This is a self-contained web application, which means it's packaged with everything it needs to run and can be executed alone. All the web static assests are served with the back-end server after build. On development mode, it requires 2 different running web server to support hot code replacement. It also has support for CDN. This document will describe the application architecture as well as detailed configurations.
